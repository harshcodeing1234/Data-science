# In Python, the __name__ variable is a built-in variable that is automatically set to the name of the current module. When a Python script is run directly, the __name__ variable is set to the string __main__ When the script is imported as a module into another script, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the module.
# Here's an example of how the if __name__ == __main__ idiom can be used:
import harsh

harsh.hello()
