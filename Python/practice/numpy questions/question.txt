View & Copy

Create a 1D array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Slice it from index 3 to 7. Change one element in the slice. Does the original array change?

Take the slice from Q1 and make a .copy(). Change an element. Does the original array change?

Create a 2D array (3,4). Slice rows 1-2, columns 2-3. Is it a view or copy? Verify using .base.

Create a 3D array (2,3,4). Slice along axis=1. Modify an element. Check if original changes.

Transpose

Create a 2D array (2,3). Apply .T and print the new shape.

Create a 3D array (2,3,4). Apply transpose(0,2,1) and print the new shape.

Show that transpose on a 1D array has no effect.

Swapaxes

Create a 2D array (3,4). Swap axes (0,1) and compare with transpose.

Create a 3D array (2,3,4). Swap axes (0,2) and print shape before & after.

Apply swapaxes twice on the same axes of a 3D array. Verify it returns to original shape.

Concatenate

Concatenate two 1D arrays [1,2,3] and [4,5,6].

Concatenate two 2D arrays (2,3) along axis=0 and axis=1.

Concatenate two 3D arrays (2,2,3) along axis=0, axis=1, and axis=2. Print shapes.

vstack

Vertically stack two 1D arrays [1,2,3] and [4,5,6].

Vertically stack two 2D arrays (1,3) and (1,3). Print shape.

Vertically stack two 3D arrays (1,2,3) and (1,2,3). Print shape.

hstack

Horizontally stack two 1D arrays [1,2,3] and [4,5,6].

Horizontally stack two 2D arrays (2,2) and (2,2). Print result.

Horizontally stack two 3D arrays (1,2,3) and (1,2,3). Print shape.

stack

Stack two 1D arrays [1,2,3] and [4,5,6] along axis=0 and axis=1. Print shapes for both.
