# Tuple basic operations
tup = (2,5,8,4)
print(type(tup),tup)

# create tuple with only one element
num = (1,) # comma is used to make tuple
print(type(num), num)

# Example
tuple1 = (1,2,2,3,5,4,6)
tuple2 = ("Red", "Green", "Blue")
print(tuple1)
print(tuple2)

# Creating a Tuple with Mixed Datatypes
tup = (5, 'Welcome', 7, 'Geeks')
print(tup)
